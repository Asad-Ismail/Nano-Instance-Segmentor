# Nano-Instance-Segmentor

Nano-Instance-Segmentor is an extension of [NanoDet](https://github.com/RangiLyu/nanodet), an efficient, lightweight object detection model, that now includes instance segmentation capabilities. This project aims to provide a high-performance yet resource-efficient solution for both object detection and instance segmentation.

## Highlights of Nano-Instance-Segmentor:

- ðŸª¶ A lightweight segmentation branch added to the original detector, enabling instance segmentation.
- âœ… Evaluation tools for instance segmentation have been included.
- ðŸ”„ Exported models for ONNX and OpenVINO formats.
- ðŸ”§ ONNX and OpenVINO formats support NMS layers.
- âš¡ High performance in terms of inference spee

| Model | Runtime | Inference(s) | FPS | Model Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ONNX model | ONNX Runtime/CPU | 0.033 seconds | 30.45 | 5MB |
| ONNX model | OpenVINO Runtime/CPU | 0.023 seconds | 43.65 | 5MB |
| OpenVINO IR model | OpenVINO Runtime/CPU | 0.021 seconds | 47.92 | 6MB |

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- ONNX Runtime 1.8.0 or later
- OpenVINO Toolkit 2022.1 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the Nano-Instance-Segmentor repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/Nano-Instance-Segmentor.git
cd Nano-Instance-Segmentor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Convert to ONNX and OpenVino
```
# For ONNX conversion
python scripts/onnx_conversion.py

# For OpenVINO conversion
python scripts/onnx_to_openvino.py
```


## Credits

This project was inspired and largely based on the work of [NanoDet](https://github.com/RangiLyu/nanodet). A huge thanks to the creators for the initial foundation.
